# Overview
I am creating a tool that allows a user to input what food(s) they are currently eating in a single meal. It will then scan a file containing all relevant information - nutrients, calories, macros - and output those values based on the amount of food you ate. It will also show you, in a percentage, how close you are to fulfilling the recommended amount of nutrients you should be ingesting per day. 

## Tools Used
Power Query - Combining data sheets together so all relevant information is in one place
Python - Language used to write the scripts '
Jupyter Notebook - IDE used
